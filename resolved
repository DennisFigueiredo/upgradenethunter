Keep your passwd backup active;)

My problem regarding the "Temporary failure resolving http.kali.org 'prevents install of metapackages'" occurring on all devices using Nethuntet has been resolved by changing the permission in the / etc / passwd file:

_apt: x: 104: 3004 :: / nonexistent: / bin / false

for

_apt: x: 0: 65534 :: / nonexistent: / bin / false

It is not necessary to perform the update of the local repository, because this change allows the bypass in the permission of the device.
